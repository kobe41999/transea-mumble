The Mumble protobuf protocol
============================

Mumble uses Protocol Buffers for its command-channel communication
in version 1.2 and greater.

This directory contains the ObjC-output from the protobuf compiler,
and a Mumble.proto protocol description fetched from the desktop
Mumble client's git repository.


Updating the protocol decription
================================

Simply run the `update-proto.sh' script in this directory to update
the protocol description. Note however that you need a protoc exe-
cutable that can output Objective-C.

Please refer to the next section of this document if you don't have
a Obj-C capable protoc.


Generating the Objective-C from Mumble.proto
============================================

To get a protobuf compiler that can output Objective-C, it is
recommended that you build the one found in the protobuf submodule:

 3rdparty/protobuf/

To build a working protobuf compiler, simply execute:

 $ ./build-protoc.sh

And you should have a working protoc executable in

 3rdparty/protobuf/src/protoc
