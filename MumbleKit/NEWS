This tracks important changes in MumbleKits API.

Feb 9 2013
==========

 - Removed the acidentally public MKConnectionController.
 - Added the concept of a main connection for audio purposes.
 - Any constructed MKConnection will implicitly register itself as
   the main connection for audio. This means that only a single
   connection may be constructed in a given application. This is
   done to ease the migration for users of MumbleKit that aren't
   Mumble for iOS.
 - In time, setting the main connection for audio purposes will be
   an explicit action. It is already exposed in the API (via MKAudio),
   but should not be touched until the implicit registration in MKConnection
   is removed.
